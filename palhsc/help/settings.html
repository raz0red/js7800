        The "Settings" dialog allows for the viewing and modification of various aspects of the JS7800 emulator. 
        Any changes that are made in the dialog can be persisted by clicking the "OK" button. Clicking the "Cancel"
        button will discard any pending changes that have been made. The "Defaults" button can be used to revert all 
        settings back to their original default values.

                Screen size
            </div>
            <div class="dialog-cell-value">
                The screen size setting controls the size of the JS7800 screen. While there are many size 
                settings available, use of an integer-based value (2x, 3x, etc.) is recommended as it 
                supports a crisp display (apply filtering disabled) without fractional pixels. 
            </div>
            <div class="dialog-cell-label">
                Aspect ratio
            </div>
            <div class="dialog-cell-value">
                The aspect ratio (AR) setting controls the ratio of the screen width to its height. By default,
                a 1:1 pixel aspect ratio (PAR) is selected that supports a crisp display (apply filtering disabled) 
                without fractional pixels. Other aspect ratios are available, including a 6:7 PAR option that 
                attempts to mimic the original ratio of the Atari 7800 console. However, ratios other than a 1:1 PAR 
                will result in fractional pixels, therefore filtering of the display (apply filter) is recommended.
            </div>
            <div class="dialog-cell-label">
                Fullscreen
            </div>
            <div class="dialog-cell-value">
                The fullscreen setting controls how the screen is scaled when in fullscreen mode. By default, 
                "fill screen" is selected, which causes the screen to scale to fill the entire screen 
                (while still maintaining the selected aspect ratio). While this option will consume the entire
                screen, it will most likely result in fractional pixels. To eliminate unwanted artifacts due 
                to fractional pixels, the "apply filter" setting can be enabled. The other available option,
                "integer scaling", causes the screen to scale vertically using an integer multiple of the 
                Atari 7800 display resolution. This setting combined with a "1:1 pixel aspect ratio" ensures
                that no fractional pixels will be present when in fullscreen mode.
            </div>

                Palette
            </div>
            <div class="dialog-cell-value">
                The palette setting controls the set of colors (color palette) used to render each frame being displayed. 
                The "ProSystem default" palette is the original palette included with the ProSystem emulator. This 
                particular palette is composed of colors that are bright and vivid, and may be preferred on 
                modern displays, but are not representative of what is actually achievable with an Atari 7800 
                connected to a CRT display. The second set of palettes (Cool, Warm, and Hot) attempt to recreate the 
                colors that would actually be experienced when connecting an Atari 7800 console to a CRT. "Cool, Warm, and Hot"
                represent the various stages of the console, from power on through having been running 
                continuously for 15-30 minutes, and its effect on the colors being displayed. Finally, the "Cool, Warm, and Hot"
                palettes are organized into two group based on the overall brightness level of the palettes.
            </div>
            <div class="dialog-cell-label">
                Apply filter
            </div>
            <div class="dialog-cell-value">
                This setting controls whether a filter is applied to the display. The actual filter applied depends
                on the particular browser and version (typically a bilinear filter). Applying a filter
                will cause the screen to have a slightly blurred appearance, but eliminates the majority of 
                artifacts that result from fractional pixels.

    <p>
        The "Keyboard Mappings" tab (shown below) is used to view and/or modify the keyboard mappings (bindings) for JS7800.

    </div>
    <p>
        Each of the red boxes indicates the key that is currently bound to a controller input or console button. 
        To modify a mapping, simply click on the red box near the input to change. Once clicked, the box will turn
        white, as shown above for button 1 of controller 1. Once the box turns white, the next key pressed will
        be mapped to that particular input. 
    </p>
    <a name="gamepads-settings"></a>
    <div class="docs-section-title">Gamepads</div>
    <p>
        The "Gamepad Compatibilty" tab (shown below) is used to determine the compatibility of the gamepads 
        (controllers) currently connected to the device running JS7800. The gamepads tab does not contain 
        any settings that can be modified.
    </p>    
    <div class="docs-center">
        <img class="docs-loading-controls-image" style="border-color: #191919" src="help/images/gamepads.png"></img>
    </div>
    <p>
        JS7800 supports up to two gamepads (for player 1 and player 2). The information boxes above each of the 
        controllers (shown in the screenshot above), indicates the type of controller that is connected, and 
        the mapping model the browser has detected. Unless the mapping is detected as, "standard", it is unlikely
        that the gamepad will be compatible with JS7800 at this time. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to detecting the type and mapping model of the gamepad, JS7800 will show how the inputs
        of the connected gamepad translate to JS7800. When the different controls on the gamepad are pressed
        (D-pad, analog sticks, buttons), a white dot (shown in the screenshot above) will appear to show what
        JS7800 control that particular input is mapped to.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most modern gamepads should be compatible with JS7800. Xbox One, Xbox 360, PS4, PS3, and Switch 
        controllers have been tested. The D-pad and left analog stick map to the joystick (or D-pad) of
        the Atari 7800 controller. The "A", "B", "X", and "O" buttons map to the Atari 7800 controller
        buttons. The "Select", "Back", and "Start" style buttons are mapped to the "SELECT" and 
        "RESET" buttons of the Atari 7800 console. Finally, the shoulder buttons are mapped to the 
        "PAUSE" button of the Atari 7800 console.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is also worth noting that Robotron-style games (Robotron and TiME Salvo) support dual analog sticks
        on controller 1 (left stick for move and right stick for fire).

    <div class="docs-section-title">High Score Settings</div>
    <p>
        The "High Score" settings tab (shown below) is used to control the persistence of high scores for 
        compatible cartridges. For a cartridge to be considered compatible, it must identify itself as 
        supporting the High Score Cartridge (HSC) via its header (<span class="fixed">.a78</span> file extension).

                There are three possible values for this setting, "(Automatic)", "Enabled", and "Disabled".
                "(Automatic)" determines whether to enable or disable the expansion

                The frame skipping setting controls the quantity of frames that should be skipped (not rendered). 
                By default, frame skipping is disabled (no frames are skipped). Frame skipping can be 
                utilized as a means of addressing performance issues experienced with JS7800. This setting
                is typically combined with disabling of the "vertical sync" setting (see below).

                The vertical sync setting controls whether the frame rate of JS7800 is synchronized with the 
                refresh rate of the monitor. Vertical sync attempts to eliminate display artifacts such as 
                screen tearing. This setting can be disabled as a means of addressing performance issues
