        JS7800 supports persisting high scores both globally and locally for compatible cartridges. For a 
        cartridge to be considered compatible, it must identify itself as supporting the High Score Cartridge (HSC)
        via its header (<span class="fixed">.a78</span> file extension). By default, global persistence of high
        scores is enabled.

        By default, the "Cartridge Drop-Down Menu" (See "Cartridge Menu" in "Cartridges" help tab on the left) contains
        a set of homebrew games that support high scores. These cartridges are contained in a 
        group titled, "High Score Compatible", near the bottom of the menu list.

        It is also important to note that when a high score is obtained, the game will prompt the player to enter a set 
        of initials to associate with the score. Entering the initials is done via the Atari 7800 controller
        (keyboard controller mappings or gamepad) versus using keyboard keys directly. In addition to letters, 
        several special characters are also present during high score entry that allow for operations such as 
        deleting characters and accepting the current initials. For example, in the screen shot above, the 
        "white square" translates to accepting the initials that have been entered.

        High score related settings can be modified via the "High Scores" tab within the "Settings" dialog. 
        For more information on high score-related settings, see the "High Scores" section of the 
        "Settings Dialog" help tab on the left.

    <p>
        JS7800 supports a global high score leaderboard. When a game that supports high scores is loaded,
        the game's current high scores are retrieved from a central high score server. If any new high scores are 
        achieved while playing the game, those scores will be published back to the central server. 
    </p>    
    <p>
        It is important to note that there is a lag when detecting that a new high score has been set and
        recording it with the central server. Therefore, it is highly recommended to wait some period of 
        time (10 seconds or so) prior to exiting the current game to ensure that the new high score is successfully
        recorded.
    </p>
    <p>
        When loading a game that does support high scores, a message stating, 
        "Global leaderboard not currently supported for this game", may be displayed. This message indicates 
        that while this particular games does indeed support high scores, it is not currently 
        registered with the global high score server. There are multiple reasons why this might be the case.
        It is possible that the game is too new and has yet to be registered with the server. But, it is most
        likely that there are multiple versions of the game, and this particular variant is not supported. 
        Multiple variants of a given game are typically not supported as each variant could have different
        scoring models, etc. A raw dump of supported games and variants (identified by cartridge MD5 hash
        without header) can be found

    <p>
        In addition to the global leaderboard, JS7800 supports the ability to save high scores to a local 
        leaderboard. Local leaderboard scores are persisted on the local device and available between
        different browser sessions (unless cookies have been explicitly disabled). 
    </p>
    <p>Unlike the global leaderboard, which limits compatibility with game variants, 
        the local leaderboard supports all high score-enabled games and variants.
